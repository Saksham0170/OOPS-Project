# OOPS-Project
Banking System Project-
This college project is a C++ program which implements a simple Bank Management System that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and display or search for account details. Account data is stored in a text file, with each account's information being saved and loaded from the file.

Features-
Create a New Account: The user can create a new bank account with an initial deposit.
Display All Accounts: Displays details of all bank accounts stored in the system.
Search Account: Search for an account using the account number.
Deposit Money: Deposit money into an existing account.
Withdraw Money: Withdraw money from an existing account (subject to sufficient balance).
Persistent Storage: Account data is saved to a text file (accounts.txt), and the last used account number is tracked in a separate file (last_account_number.txt).

Structure-
The program uses a BankAccount class to represent individual accounts. Each account has an account number, account holder name, and balance. The class provides methods for displaying account details, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The account data is read from and written to a text file using stream.
